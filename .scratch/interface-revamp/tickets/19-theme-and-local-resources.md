# 19: Choose a coherent local light or dark presentation

## Parent

[Revamp the interface: responsive map editing with preserved local work](../spec.md). Source request: [Revamp the interface](https://github.com/Submoon/ttrpg-cluster-control/issues/3).

The human approved the twelve-ticket breakdown and exact dependencies on 2026-10-16. Approved planning baseline: `f4aa1b4438217412c308e61733d862f3d71597ca`, intentionally above `origin/main = 629d2a98715c3a16b954e0f77c639b1f0c31212c`. See the [approved proposal](../research/ticket-breakdown-proposal-2026-10-16.md).

## What to build

One named theme control updates shell, maps, native controls and portals; the explicit device/browser preference survives sessions/workspaces and overrides later OS changes.

## Acceptance criteria

1. [ ] Follow OS preference until explicit choice, then persist that separate preference.
2. [ ] Apply common tokens and actual contrast/non-color/focus states throughout existing surfaces.
3. [ ] Preserve all data, drafts/errors, placements, selection, view/tool and saving state without a workspace save.
4. [ ] Package every static/dynamic icon locally and prove cold glyph rendering with external Internet denied to both browser and server while the app remains reachable.
5. [ ] Verify hydrated SSR and keyboard/touch/mobile portals.

## Scope and exclusions

Shared palette/preference/resources, not a theme engine or all-form redesign. Image scenes are 28; later owners extend these tokens.

## Blocked by

- [Open and recover the real local workspace at the product root](18-open-and-recover-local-workspace.md)

Dependency rationale: 18 — acceptance must target the real product/SSR entry.

## Specification and evidence mapping

primary 103–111; checks 82, 89–90, 119–120. **B:** B4, B9.

Story numbers refer to the [specification user stories](../spec.md#user-stories). B1–B10 refer to the [behavioral acceptance families](../research/spec-test-seams-2026-10-16.md#smallest-useful-high-level-acceptance-suite). Required checks extend crosscutting contracts; primary ownership alone does not certify other owners or the whole product.

## Required product constraints

- Deliver the real persisted-workspace product, never the memory-only sample. Preserve working baseline commands until their replacements work. Use Nuxt UI to the greatest practical extent: evaluate configuration, slots and adapters before bespoke equivalents and document the smallest justified exception. Keep the SSR shell/client maps and one provider/CSS integration.
- Preserve domain vocabulary, authoritative validation, references, host/recovery corrections, database `ttrpg-cluster-control`, marker `ttrpg-cluster-control-map`, schema/version and applicable drag identities. Support accepted older shapes inside that marker/version boundary; add no migration or previous-marker fallback, durable drafts, renderer or unrelated feature.
- At affected seams, own session draft identity/content/errors above presentation lifetime; hide/theme/reflow retain work. Refuse actual target/dependency conflicts before preview while allowing independent commands. Apply validates latest committed memory and ends its designated session before durable saving; failure retains applied data with truthful recovery. Scoped Cancel never undoes committed work. Preparation is read-only, and changed destructive effects require renewed review. Backup restoration retains its distinct durable-before-publication guarantee.
- Verify relevant light/dark states, useful text >=4.5:1 and meaningful graphics/controls >=3:1 against actual adjacent/composited backgrounds, non-color cues, names/help, visible unobscured focus, modal entry/return and keyboard/single-pointer alternatives. Automate relevant mobile portrait/landscape/touch/reduced-height flows; 390×844, 844×390 and 390×500 are useful starting viewports. Target Android Chrome only for supplementary real OS-keyboard open/closed, safe-area and physical gesture checks. Simulation is not physical proof; report unavailable gates explicitly, without invented passes or a new device/CI harness. Desktop support retains baseline scope.
- This feature owns its acceptance tests now; final cleanup does not supply missing feature checks. Record source/runtime/product route, validated fixture, viewport/browser/device/input and passed/failed/unexecuted/unavailable outcomes and limits. Preserve user storage with isolated browser contexts; historical prototype passes are prior art, not current integrated acceptance.

## Validation strategy

Use cold browser/server resource checks with external Internet denied but the app reachable, actual glyph inspection, OS/explicit preference changes and reload/new-session checks. Measure actual composited contrast and inspect both maps/native controls/portal palettes, focus and preserved draft/save state.

The primary seam is the real integrated product through the existing Playwright browser suite, with narrow codec/domain/storage tests only for the relevant invariant. Use actual downloads and durable reload where applicable. Run affected checks and appropriate typecheck/build; compiled-production presentation checks supplement development iteration. No new application test API or separate component harness is required.

## Execution and handoff

Coordination and analysis use `gpt-6.1-sol` at High effort; delegated implementation uses `gpt-6-luna` at XHigh effort, as requested by the human. Follow the [project-development workflow](../../../.agents/skills/project-development/SKILL.md), including complexity/risk routing, required architecture contracts and independent reviews; sensitive persistence, destructive operations and interchange require complementary technical and domain/data review. Delegated specialists stay within their assigned scope and do not restart routing.

No implementation has started and no assignee is set. Work blockers-first; preserve other agents' work. Return changed behavior, evidence identities/outcomes/limitations and unresolved findings to the coordinator. This ticket does not authorize GitHub writes, source-issue closure, merge or deployment.
